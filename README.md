# EfficientNet Fine-Tuned Classifier

This repository demonstrates **fine-tuning EfficientNet** for image classification tasks using **Transfer Learning** with PyTorch.

## 📚 Description

In this project:
- A **pre-trained EfficientNet model** is fine-tuned on a **custom dataset**.
- Transfer learning is applied to speed up training and improve model accuracy.
- Key evaluation metrics and sample predictions are visualized.

### 🔑 Key Highlights:
- Fine-tuning of **EfficientNet (e.g., EfficientNet-B0, B1)** for custom image classification tasks.
- Dataset preprocessing with normalization and augmentation.
- Training and evaluation pipelines using **PyTorch**.
- Detailed visualization of model performance.
